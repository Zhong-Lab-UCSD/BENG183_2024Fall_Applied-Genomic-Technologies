## What is Spatial Transcriptomics?

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a cutting-edge approach that combines genomics and spatial information to localize gene expression within tissue samples. It bridges the gap left by single-cell RNA sequencing, which lacks the ability to maintain spatial context due to tissue dissociation.

### Key Techniques
- **In Situ Capture**: Tags tissue coordinates with oligonucleotide barcodes, mapping extracted mRNA back to specific tissue regions.
- **In Situ Hybridization**: Hybridizes oligos to RNA at known positions and gleans spatial data from that.
-**In Situ Sequencing**: Uses a circular probe arm and an RCA amplification to tag known RNA

### Advantages
- Provides a detailed map of cellular activity within a tissue's structural context.
- Facilitates studies of complex systems like tumor microenvironments or brain tissue architecture.

- In Situ Hyb and Seq are both more cost efficient than In Situ Capture, and provide more accurate results. Their main trade off is that they are reliant on targeting known genes.

- In Situ Capture has the advantage of being able to identify novel spatial information for genes

## Relevance to Cancer

Tumor heterogeneity, which refers to genetic variability and differing gene expression within a tumor, is a major challenge in oncology. 

Understanding this variability is important, because this way researchers can tailor personalized treatments on a patient by patient basis.

- By overlaying spatial info with sequencing data, researchers have been able to identify tissues that show evidence of infiltration by cancer cells, which generally has a better prognosis and patient outcome if identified in the early onset stages. 

### Importance of Spatial Data
- **Identifies Cellular Subpopulations**: Based on the spatial data of differing gene expression, spatial data is able to identify cell populations.
- **Tailors Therapies**: Enables development of targeted treatments for specific tumor regions based on the knowledge of differing gene expression at these locations.
- **Reveals Microenvironments**: Investigates the interaction between tumor cells and their surroundings.

## Applications I: Clustering

Clustering techniques are invaluable for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. By grouping data based on similarity, clustering reveals patterns in tissue organization and gene expression.

## Dimensionality Reduction

### **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique designed to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much variance as possible. This is achieved by transforming the original data into a new coordinate system defined by **principal components**, which are linear combinations of the original features.  

#### **Key Steps**:  
- **Standardization**: Normalize data to ensure each feature contributes equally to variance.  
- **Covariance Matrix**: Compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data to measure feature relationships.  
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Identify the eigenvalues (variance) and eigenvectors (directions) of the covariance matrix.  
- **Projection**: Project the data onto a smaller subset of principal components ranked by eigenvalue magnitude.  

#### **Advantages**:  
- Effective for high-dimensional datasets where features are highly correlated.  
- Enables noise reduction and visualization of multi-dimensional data.  
- Provides interpretable axes representing variance in the data.  

#### **Limitations**:  
- Assumes linear relationships between features, which may not always hold.  
- Does not preserve local or global geometric structures in non-linear datasets.

### **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**  
UMAP is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that emphasizes preserving the local and global structure of data when projecting it into lower dimensions (e.g., 2D or 3D). It is particularly suited for visualizing clusters and patterns in complex datasets.  

#### **Key Concepts**:  
- **Graph Construction**: Creates a weighted graph of the data, where nodes represent data points and edge weights represent their similarities (based on nearest neighbors).  
- **Manifold Approximation**: Models the high-dimensional data as a manifold, aiming to preserve the relationships between points.  
- **Optimization**: Uses stochastic gradient descent to optimize the layout of points in lower dimensions while minimizing distortion of the graph structure.  

#### **Advantages**:  
- Captures both local relationships (e.g., nearest neighbors) and global structure (e.g., clusters).  
- Efficient and faster than similar methods like t-SNE.  
- Ideal for exploratory data analysis and visualizing patterns in large datasets.  

#### **Limitations**:  
- Less interpretable than PCA due to its non-linear nature.  
- Sensitive to hyperparameters such as the number of neighbors and minimum distance between points.  
- Requires careful tuning to balance local and global preservation.

### **Comparison**:  
| Feature                | PCA                               | UMAP                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Type**              | Linear                           | Non-linear                       |
| **Preserves**         | Global variance                  | Local and global relationships   |
| **Speed**             | Faster for small datasets        | Scales well to large datasets    |
| **Interpretability**  | High (eigenvectors as axes)      | Low (manifold projection)        |
| **Applications**      | Feature reduction, preprocessing | Visualization, clustering         |

Both techniques are valuable tools depending on the dataset's nature and the analysis goals. PCA is best for variance retention and interpretability, while UMAP excels in visualizing clusters in complex, non-linear datasets.

### Applications
- **Inter-Tumor Heterogeneity**: Distinguishes genetic differences across tumor sections.
- **Mapping Subpopulations**: Identifies unique cell types and their spatial distributions.

## Applications II: Deconvolution

Deconvolution predicts the proportions of various cell types in a tissue, enhancing the resolution of spatial transcriptomics data.

### Redeconve
- Utilizes linear regression to estimate cell type proportions.
- Efficiently detects differences in cell populations, such as cytotoxic T cells in immune responses.

Deconvolution reduces costs and computational complexity, making it accessible for large-scale studies.
